In your README markdown file, include the following:
-   Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### Overview

The purpose of the analysis was research the Citi Bikes from New York City in order to start the same business here in Des Moines. During the creation of the propoasl we used Tableau, a powerful visualization too, to create visualizations to tell of the story of how Citi Bike operates. We wanted data on trip duration, starting and stopping locations, and hours of the day that saw teh most use. We also wanted to know who the user was, men or women, young or older and/or a casual user or subscriber.
    
#### Results:
![1.graphic](Resources/1.checkouttimeXcountofbikes.png)
This chart will allow you to look at each hour of the day. Using the Hour of TripDuration filter will show you exact numbers,if you select (1) one option and an average if you select more than one. The data is skewed on the 0 hour so selecting any other hour with the '0' will skew the chart.

![2.graphic](Resources/2.checkoutimesXcountXgender.png)
This chart is similar to the previous one, selecting '0' will skew the chart. Here you can see the genders of the users of Citi Bike. The men are the primary users of this product.

![3.graphic](Resources/3. peakhoursXweekday.png)
The graphic above shows the peak hours for each weekday indicated by the darker red color.

![4.graphic](Resources/4.usertypeXgenderXweekday.png)
This charts shows usertype against gender. The heaviest users are male on everyday of the week and they are also more likely to be a subscriber and not a casual customer.

![5.graphic](Resources/5.startendtimesXgenderX.png)
Similar to the last chart, this chart indicates that while men do use the bikes more often during most hours of the day. The women also tend to use the bikes more often during the peak hours and Saturday in comparison to thier usual usage.

![6.graphic](Resources/6.PeakHoursAvg.png)
This chart shows the peak hours of the day. Take note of the 7am to 10am and the 4pm to 7pm rush hour blocks, this is an important metric to know but there is also an important time period here. There are built-in maintenence hours everyday from 2 am to 4am, where we will be able to service the bikes with minor inconvience to the customer.

![7.graphic](Resources/7.utilizationchart.png)
The Utilization chart will allow you to see which bikes are being used more often. Thus which bikes are most likely to need maintenence. The larger red to reddish circles will have pop-ups with the BikeId and the count of trips.
-   Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
